# Inspired by OPEN AI CLIP Model to do text to image search 

I trained  Distill bert model with pretrained weights and resnet50 model with num_classes as zero & pooling as "avg" . It my small implementation of the CLIP Model.

We need to increase the cosine similarity between image & text and i got a perplexity value of 4.5 and i stopped training after it .

Model was implemented based on below search paper.
